Make sure that you set the default spdlog's eol in ```cusp/dependencies/spdlog/include/spdlog/tweakme.h``` from ```#define SPDLOG_EOL ";-)\n"``` to ```#define SPDLOG_EOL ""```
  
  

## For Linux

  

1.  On your console, enter ``` premake5 gmake```

2. Then ``` make config=release```

3. From ```/bin/cusp/Release/``` directory, copy cusp binary to a location inside your system's path variable.

  

## For Windows

  

1. Open command prompt and enter ```premake5 vs2017``` for Visual Studio 2017 or ```premake5 vs2019``` for Visual Studio 2019
